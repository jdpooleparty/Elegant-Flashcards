What is the primary goal of Internet Protocol?,"The goal is to transfer data from one side of the network to another, using processes to transfer large amounts of data between devices."
What analogy is used to describe data transfer in a network?,"Data transfer is compared to using a moving truck to transfer items from one house to another. The truck represents the Internet Protocol, and the road represents the network."
What are the 'roads' in the analogy of data transfer?,"The roads represent the network, which could be a wired Ethernet network, a wireless network, or other types of network connections."
What does the 'moving truck' represent in the data transfer analogy?,"The moving truck represents the Internet Protocol (IP), which is responsible for moving data across the network."
What are the boxes inside the moving truck in the data transfer analogy?,"The boxes represent TCP or UDP protocols, which contain application data that needs to be transferred between devices."
What is encapsulation in the context of data transfer?,"Encapsulation is the process of packaging data within protocols, which are themselves encapsulated within larger protocols, to transfer data across the network."
What is found in the Ethernet frame when transferring data between a client and server?,"An Ethernet frame contains an Ethernet header, Ethernet payload, and Ethernet trailer. Inside the Ethernet payload, there is IP information, which further contains TCP or UDP data."
How do TCP and UDP differ in their communication methods?,"TCP is a connection-oriented protocol with formal processes for session setup and teardown, providing reliable delivery with acknowledgments. UDP is a connectionless protocol with no formal session setup, no acknowledgments, and no error recovery."
What layer of the OSI model do TCP and UDP operate at?,"TCP and UDP operate at OSI Layer 4, the transport layer."
What is multiplexing in the context of network communication?,Multiplexing refers to the efficient transfer of multiple applications simultaneously across the network between devices.
What feature of TCP ensures reliable delivery of data?,"TCP ensures reliable delivery by requiring acknowledgments from the receiving device, which allows for error recovery and retransmission of lost data."
Why is UDP considered an 'unreliable' protocol?,"UDP is considered unreliable because it doesn't send acknowledgments, doesn't provide error recovery, and has no flow control mechanism."
What are IP addresses used for in network communication?,"IP addresses are used to provide destination information for data transfer, similar to how a moving truck needs an address to deliver items."
What are TCP and UDP port numbers used for?,"Port numbers identify specific applications running on a device, directing data to the appropriate application, similar to how different rooms in a house receive specific deliveries."
What are nonephemeral and ephemeral ports?,"Nonephemeral ports are permanent ports used by servers (e.g., port 80, 443), while ephemeral ports are temporary ports used by clients (typically in the range 1024 to 65535)."
Can both TCP and UDP use the same port numbers?,"Yes, TCP and UDP can use the same port numbers, but they are treated as different, separate ports for each protocol."
How does port number usage affect network security?,Changing port numbers doesn't provide security. A firewall is required to control traffic flow and ensure security.
