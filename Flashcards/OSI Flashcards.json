[{"question": "What are the seven layers of the OSI model?", "answer": "Layer 1 - Physical, Layer 2 - Data link, Layer 3 - Network, Layer 4 - Transport, Layer 5 - Session, Layer 6 - Presentation, Layer 7 - Application."}, {"question": "What is the function of Layer 1 (Physical) in the OSI model?", "answer": "Handles the physical connection between devices, including cables, connectors, and signaling."}, {"question": "What is the role of Layer 2 (Data Link) in the OSI model?", "answer": "Ensures node-to-node data transfer, error detection, and correction. Uses protocols like Ethernet and devices like switches."}, {"question": "What happens in Layer 3 (Network) of the OSI model?", "answer": "Manages data routing, addressing, and packet forwarding using protocols like IP, and devices like routers."}, {"question": "What is the function of Layer 4 (Transport) in the OSI model?", "answer": "Ensures reliable data transfer with error recovery and flow control, using protocols like TCP and UDP."}, {"question": "What does Layer 5 (Session) in the OSI model handle?", "answer": "Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between applications."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of Layer 6 (Presentation) in the OSI model?", "answer": "Translates data formats, encrypts/decrypts data, and manages data compression."}, {"question": "What happens in Layer 7 (Application) of the OSI model?", "answer": "Interfaces with software applications. Common protocols include HTTP, FTP, and SMTP."}, {"question": "What is the role of a Router in a network?", "answer": "Connects multiple networks and routes traffic between them."}, {"question": "What does a Switch do in a network?", "answer": "Connects devices within a network and uses MAC addresses to forward data."}, {"question": "What is a Firewall's function?", "answer": "Monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules."}, {"question": "What is the difference between IDS and IPS?", "answer": "IDS (Intrusion Detection System) monitors network traffic for suspicious activities, while IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) actively prevents these activities."}, {"question": "What is a Load Balancer used for?", "answer": "Distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance."}, {"question": "What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?", "answer": "A system that distributes content to users based on their geographic location to improve performance."}, {"question": "What is a Virtual Private Network (VPN)?", "answer": "A secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet."}, {"question": "What does Quality of Service (QoS) do?", "answer": "Manages network resources by setting priorities for specific types of data."}, {"question": "What does Time to Live (TTL) mean in networking?", "answer": "A value that limits the lifespan of data in a network to prevent it from circulating indefinitely."}, {"question": "What is Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)?", "answer": "Virtualizes network services that traditionally run on proprietary hardware."}, {"question": "What is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?", "answer": "A private cloud within a public cloud environment, providing an isolated section for users."}, {"question": "What is the difference between NAT and PAT?", "answer": "NAT (Network Address Translation) allows multiple devices to share a single public IP, while PAT (Port Address Translation) maps private IP addresses and ports to a single public IP."}, {"question": "What does a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) do?", "answer": "Segregates network traffic to enhance performance and security within a network."}, {"question": "What is Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)?", "answer": "STP prevents network loops by creating a loop-free topology in Ethernet networks."}, {"question": "What is the difference between WPA2 and WPA3?", "answer": "WPA2 provides strong encryption (AES) for wireless networks, while WPA3 improves encryption and security over WPA2."}, {"question": "What is a mesh network?", "answer": "A network where devices (nodes) are interconnected, and data can take multiple paths to reach its destination."}, {"question": "What are the two types of wireless antennas?", "answer": "Omnidirectional antennas broadcast signals in all directions, while directional antennas focus signals in one direction."}, {"question": "What does SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) do?", "answer": "Used for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and modifying device behavior."}, {"question": "What is a Recovery Point Objective (RPO)?", "answer": "The maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time, in the event of a disaster."}, {"question": "What is a Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?", "answer": "The maximum amount of time allowed to restore operations after a disaster or failure."}, {"question": "What is a honeypot in cybersecurity?", "answer": "A system intentionally exposed to attract and analyze attackers' behavior."}, {"question": "What is DNS Poisoning?", "answer": "Corrupting a DNS cache to redirect users to malicious websites."}, {"question": "What is a VLAN hopping attack?", "answer": "An attack where a device on one VLAN is able to access another VLAN it should not be able to reach."}]
